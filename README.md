# Smart Campus Navigation Assistant

This project uses two AI search algorithms — **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **A\*** — to find the shortest route between two points on a simulated university campus map.  

## Project Overview
The program compares BFS and A* performance on a grid-based map with obstacles.  
It demonstrates how heuristic-based search can improve efficiency while maintaining optimal results.

## Algorithms
- **BFS:** Explores all routes level by level; always finds the shortest path but slower.  
- **A\*:** Uses Manhattan distance heuristic for faster and directed search.

## Results
Both algorithms found the same shortest path, but A\* explored fewer nodes and ran faster.
